## [Section 2] Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Brief Description

**SilentBid** is a **[Sealed-Bid Auction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sealed-bid-auction.asp)** platform built using the *
*Plonky3** toolkit. The project's primary goal is to enable secure and private auctions by utilizing **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**
to determine the highest bidder without revealing individual bid amounts. This ensures both privacy and fairness in the bidding
process.

In addition to its practical use, **SilentBid** also serves as a **reference model** for developers interested in building
decentralized applications (dApps) using **Plonky3** and ZKPs.

### Core Idea

The core concept allows bidders to submit encrypted bids into a smart contract, readable only by the auction owner using their secret
key. At the auction's conclusion, the owner publishes the winner. **ZKPs** ensure that the auction owner reads all bids and selects the
highest one, without revealing their private key.

Key components of the project include:

- **Proving Service**: Powered by **Plonky3**, this service generates a **zero-knowledge proof** from the execution trace of a program
  that decrypts the bids and computes the winner, while preserving the confidentiality of individual bid amounts and the owner's
  private key.
- **Smart Contract**: The contract verifies the ZK proof and manages the entire auction lifecycle, including setup, bidding, and
  settlement.

### Technology Stack

- **Smart Contract**: Solidity
- **Circuit**: Rust, Plonky3

### Design Mockups/Prototypes (Optional)

The core logic of **SilentBid** operates on-chain, while off-chain processes handle the winner calculation and proof generation. The
auction process follows four main phases:

1. **Initial Setup**: The auction owner creates the auction, sets the required deposit amount that anyone who want to participate will
   have to pay upfront, transfers assets to the smart contract, and defines the starting/ending auction time.
2. **Bid Phase**: Bidders submit their bids to the smart contract by depositing the required amount.
3. **Open Phase**: After the bidding window closes, the auction owner calculate the winner and generate the zero-knowledge proof.
4. **Verify Phase**: The owner submits the winner and the proof to the smart contract for verification on-chain, completing the
   auction.

**Sequence diagrams for each module are shown below:**

#### Prover & Verifier Flow:

#### Circuit Pseudo Code:

```ts
function get_winner(
    witness: {
        owner_private_key: string
    },
    public_params: {
        encrypted_bids: EncryptedBid[]
    }
): { winner: address, input_hash: string } {

    // Decrypt all encrypted bids using the owner's private key
    const bids: Bid[] = public_params.encrypted_bids.map(enc_bid =>
        decrypt_bid(witness.owner_private_key, enc_bid)
    );

    // Find the winning bid based on auction criteria
    const winner_bid: Bid = find_max(bids);

    // Generate a hash of the input parameters for verification
    const input_hash: string = hash(public_params);

    // Return the winner's address and the input hash for verification
    return {
        winner: winner_bid.bidder,
        input_hash
    };
}

// Define the Bid type
type Bid = {
    bidder: address,
    amount: number
};
```

    }

    /**

    function bid(uint256 auction, Bid memory bid) public {
        // Logic for placing a bid
    }

    /**
     * @notice Reveals the winner after the auction ends.
     * @dev Uses a ZK-proof to reveal the highest valid bid.
     */
    function revealWinner(uint256 auction, Winner memory winner, bytes32 inputHash, bytes memory proof) public {
        verifyProof(winner, inputHash, proof);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Auction winner claims the item.
     */
    function claim() public {
        // Logic for claiming the auction item
    }

    /**
     * @notice Verifies a zero-knowledge proof.
     */
    function verifyProof(Winner memory winner, bytes32 inputHash, bytes memory proof) private {
        // ZK-proof verification logic
    }
}
```

## [Section 3] Ecosystem Fit

### Similar Projects

Several research papers have explored the concept of sealed-bid auctions on the blockchain,
including [Anonymous Fair Auction on Blockchain](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9432664)
and [A Blockchain-Based Sealed-Bid e-Auction Scheme with Smart Contract and Zero-Knowledge Proof](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351717293_A_Blockchain-Based_Sealed-Bid_e-Auction_Scheme_with_Smart_Contract_and_Zero-Knowledge_Proof).
However, these solutions assume the verifier holds both a private and public key, which is impractical for smart contracts. Projects
like [AuctionContract](https://github.com/HSG88/AuctionContract) focus solely on developing bussiness logic inside a smart contract
without addressing the complete system for secure, private auctions.

### Unique Contribution

**SilentBid** provides a **practical reference** for developers looking to build **ZK-based dApps**, showcasing how **Plonky3**can
solve real-world problems.
